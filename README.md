🏗️ Predicting the Strength of Concrete

📌 Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its composition and age. By analyzing ingredients such as cement, water, aggregates, and admixtures, we can estimate how strong the concrete will be — a crucial property in civil engineering and construction.

🎯 Objectives
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand material composition and relationships.
Build and evaluate different regression models for prediction.
Compare models using performance metrics such as RMSE and R² score.
Provide insights into the most influential features affecting concrete strength.
